/**
 * One of the ways we can implement this pattern in Java is by using the clone() method. To do this, we'd implement the Cloneable interface.
 *
 * When we're trying to clone, we should decide between making a shallow or a deep copy. Eventually, it boils down to the requirements.
 *
 * For example, if the class contains only primitive and immutable fields, we may use a shallow copy.
 *
 * If it contains references to mutable fields, we should go for a deep copy. We might do that with copy constructors or serialization and deserialization.
 *
 * Let's see how to apply the Prototype pattern without using the Cloneable interface. In order to do this, let's create an abstract class called Tree with an abstract method â€˜copy'.
