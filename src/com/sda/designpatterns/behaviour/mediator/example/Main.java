// Imagine we're building a simple cooling system that consists of a fan, a power supply, and a button.
// Pressing the button will either turn on or turn off the fan.
// Before we turn the fan on, we need to turn on the power.
// Similarly, we have to turn off the power right after the fan is turned off.
