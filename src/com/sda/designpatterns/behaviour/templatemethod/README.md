## TEMPLATE METHOD

**It makes it easier to implement complex algorithms by encapsulating logic in a single method.**

##### Objective: 

to define the schema of the algorithm

##### Characteristics:

- simple implementation (minimum of two objects)
- use of abstract classes
- use of interfaces with default methods
- use of the inheritance mechanism

##### CONSTRUCTION - TEMPLATE METHOD

- abstract class/interface
- "elements" of algorithms to be implemented
- the schema of the algorithm is represented by the "elements" to be implemented
- implementation of the base class
- definition of moving parts ("elements" of the algorithm)
- template_method

Example: JUnit and test life cycle methods
