/**
 * Create a Car enum class with FERRARI, PORSCHE, MERCEDES, BMW, OPEL, FIAT, TOYOTA etc. constants.
 * Each vehicle has its own parameters, e.g. price, power, etc. Enum should contain boolean isPremium() and
 * boolean isRegular() methods. The isPremium() method should return the opposite result to the call of the
 * isRegular() method.
 * In addition, the boolean isFasterThan() method should be declared and implemented as part of the enum
 * class. This method should accept the Car type object and display information that the indicated vehicle is
 * faster or not than the vehicle provided in the argument. To do this, use the compareTo() method
